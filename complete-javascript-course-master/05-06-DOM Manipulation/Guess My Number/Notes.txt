DOM - Document Object Model
Structured Representation of HTML Documents. Allows Javascript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.
The DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML page loads.


DOM Methods and Properties are not Javascript, they come from the web APIs.
Web APIs are like libraries that browser implement and can be accesses from Javascript code.
